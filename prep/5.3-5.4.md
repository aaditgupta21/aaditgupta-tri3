## 5.3 Notes
- Programs can be biased when not trained on all groups. In the video we learned that because the program didn't categorize different races it wasn't able to detect the face. The facial recognition software couldn't recognize darker skin tones.
- There can be biases in all types of software programs. 

## 5.4 Notes
- Ask all csp kids about their repl it projects and get input on how to improve them.
- One crowdsourcing idea would be to get everyones school photos and make one big dataset of it. So if someone is in a photo they don't have they can see it. Crowdsourcing would help our project as it would let us get a lot of input on an ASB website.
