## 5.1 Notes
- Three beneficial effects of computing are problem solving, team skills, and better communication
- Three harmful effects of computing are eye strain, social skills, sleep deprivation.
- Dopamine effects are a common issue. For example, students would rather play complete the next mission in a video game than start a project for school. For me this does not happen usually as I am not a big fan of video games but sometimes I do feel like I rather just be on social media than doing homework.

## 5.2 Notes
- People empower themself in the digital world by gaining a voice in society. With technology people have finally been able to create a movement about something they believe in. Technology has allowed change to come in our world
- Someone that is empowered could help the person not. For example, with older people who do not know much about technology. Us students can help them and teach how to be safe online and how technology has helped our world.
- I think we should remove the internet block at our school as it isn't really helping students. Instead of focusing on school work, students focus on ways to bypass the block such as VPNS. I don't think paper is blocking digital empowerment but it is teaching us students that we can do the same work with technology or paper
